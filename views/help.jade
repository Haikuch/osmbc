    The article has the following properties:

    * **title** 
      Used internally for display purposes only

    * **collection**
      Free text (english / german) to describe the idea, or the collect the html link

    * **markdown**
      german markdown text

    * **markdownEN**
      english markdown text (no process for weekly defined yet)

    * **blog**
      Reference to the blog number

    * **category** 
      Reference to the category in the blog
      (categories can be redefined per blog)

    Additional on the blog page there is an editor for the blog name, and the categories of the blog.
    This editor will be improved in future. If you rename a blog, the article become orphan and can be found with the article nav bar item.
