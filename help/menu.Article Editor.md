# The Article Editor


## Principle

The article editor does have two modes, a view mode and an edit mode.

## The View Mode

### Commenting

The view mode allowes commenting and editing your comments. 
Just type your comment into the editor. You can mention other user or languages
by the @ sign (e.g. @TheFive will notify me, @DE will notify all users, that are
interested in the DE language). 
You can configure your notification interest (for mail notification) in your personal settings.

The Inbox in OSMBC notifys for comments, where you are personally mentioned, and all
comments mentioning your "first" language (the left one) in the menu bar.

Comments are "#open" or "#solved". A solved comment is not shown in the blog overviews.
You can set the status simply by typing #solved or #open in your comments.

### No Translation

If an article is not relevant for all languages and these languages are already edited,
you can use the button below the language indicator to set the missing languages to
"no translation", the status, where the article is skipped in that language.

## The Edit Mode

In the edit mode you can change most fields of an article.

On the top you can reassign the article to another blog, e.g. move it to the next week,
or in future blog. Warning, do not move an article, if in one language it is already published.
(There is no check for this now).

Choose a category for the article. Whats an category is for is shown direct near the selector.

An article can have an predecessor (in the same category) to indicate the position of an
article in a blog. So if some articles belong together, you can "bind" them close together.

If no predecessor is set, the articles are sorted by the title in alphabetical order.

The title is used only internal for the other editor, to have a compact description, what the article is about.

OSMBC separates all links form your collection and shows them under the collection field (together
with the google translate links).

The markdown editor supports link pasting in two ways:

If you select a word and past a link on it, the word will become the visible part of the link, and OSMBC 
creates the correct markdown link.
If you paste a link without a selection, a markdown link is generated and the cursor is set between the [],
so that you can direct type the visible part of the link.

For the german language the language flags are shown. Click on a flag, to copy the 
markdown link for the flag to the clipboard.

OSMBC supports drag & drop for the markdown editor. You can drag & drop the flags and the
links from the collection into the markdown field. If you choose a translation link, the
(automatic translation) is created. (If someone has a good [bable fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_races_and_species_in_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Babel_fish) icon, i can take that
instead of the text :-) ).

And finally, just type - into a markdown field to set it to no translation.
