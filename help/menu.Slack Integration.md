# How To Use Slack For Collecting Articles

## Principle

As it is not possible to implement integrations for every platform, OSMBC integrates common used platforms.

For now only Slack is supported. You can send any link (or text) to Slack, and - as soon as OSMBC is recognizing your OSM Account - this
is written to OSMBC. 
Please add your Slack user name to your profile. Otherwise OSMBC can't assign the collect to your user
and will ignore your message.

As there is no interactive doublet check, the link is not collected direct to the current open blog, but it is written
in a to do list. This is called TBC. (To Be Collected).

TBC is somehow like a normal "blog", but with some restricted features. If there is any item in the to do list (yours or by 
another editor) it is show in the menu bar. 
If something is in your "personal" TBC the blog is displayed with a red badge and the number of collections you have to check.
The TBC view is intended for mobile view although.

## Usage On Mobile Devices

On a Mobile you need to have Slack installed. Please use the standard way of your browser / twitter client to send a link, and sent this link to
the channel osmbcarticle. (may vary in different slacks). Thats all.
The "quality" of the resulting article depends on the software you use. Typically you can check the text that is exported
in the application direct.
Some clients are just exporting a link to a tweet (thats what is nice with OSMBC), some clients add some words before the link.
This results in OSMBC is not able to expand the twitter link.

To work on your TBC List just to to the OSMBC Page.

## Usage On Desktop

There is a Chrome Plugin ("#Clicky for Slack") that allows you to send an url to Slack too. I assume there will be plugins for other browsers too.
To install the plugin you are may be requested to generate a test api key. Please do so, but keep your personal key secret, it is like a password.

Send your article to osmbcarticle, and control your links in the TBC blog.

If you find other forms to use the Slack Integration on a desktop, please inform the author.
