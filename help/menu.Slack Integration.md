# How To Use Slack For Collecting Articles

## Principle

As it is not possible to implement integrations for every platform, common used platforms are integrated in OSMBC.

For now this is Slack. You can send any link to slack, and - as soon as OSMBC is recognizing your OSM Account - this
is written to OSMBC. But as there was no doublet check, this is not collected direct to the open blog, but it is written
in a way like a to do list. It is moved in the TBC Blog (To Be Collected).

This blog is show in the menu bar, as soon as there is an article, waiting on validation. With the badge in the user color 
it is signaled, that you have something to OSMBC but did not classify it yet.
