# How To Use Slack For Collecting Articles

## Principle

As it is not possible to implement integrations for every platform, common used platforms are integrated in OSMBC.

For now this is Slack. You can send any link to slack, and - as soon as OSMBC is recognizing your OSM Account - this
is written to OSMBC. But as there was no doublet check, this is not collected direct to the open blog, but it is written
in a way like a to do list. It is moved in the TBC Blog (To Be Collected).

This blog is show in the menu bar, as soon as there is an article, waiting on validation. With the badge in the user color 
it is signaled, that you have something to OSMBC but did not classify it yet. The TBC view is intended for mobile view although.

## Usage On Mobile

On a Mobile you need to have slack installed. Please use the standard way of your browser to send a link, and sent this link to
the channel osmbcarticle. (may vary in different slacks). Thats all.

## Usage On Desktop

There is a Chrome Plugin (#Clicky for Slack) that allows you to send an url to slack too. I assume there will be plugins for other browsers too.
To install the plugin you are may be requested to generate a test api key. Please do so, but keep your personal key secret, it is like a password.

Send your article to osmbcarticle, and control your links in the TBC blog.
